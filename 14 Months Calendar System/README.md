This document proposes an idea for a calendar system that should work perfectly through the year
without the need of any adjustments or modifications. I think that the calendar we use today have
problems such as the need to add/subtract days every couple of years... follows odd patern such as 30-
31-30.... etc

# Notes:

I forgot to mension in the document how I noticed the long/short 7 days. Simply by:

1. For each year, there is 2 unique days, in these 2 Unique days (let's call them peek days), the sun daylight period is the same each year. For example, in some place in the earth, the longest day is 21 June of each year, and the sun shines for the same period in that day (16 hours for example) each year. Same for the shortest day, which for example, 21 December, the sun shines for shortets period of time compared with other days of the year, and for the same period of time each year (8 hours for example).
2. There are 3 Days before a peek day and 3 Days after a peek day, the sun shines (daylight) period is the same with only seconds diffirance. That's mean, we have 7 days (18 June to 24 June, 21 June is the long-peek) long days (with longest daylight period) and repeat each year, and we have another 7 short days (18 December to 24 December, 21 December is the short-peek) when the sun shines (daylight) is the shortest in year and repeat each year.
3. There is exact number of days between these 2 peek days.
4. Not neseccary dates (June/December) match in all places in the earth, the point is we can always find 7 long and 7 short days anywhere in the earth for a year.
